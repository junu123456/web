  <h2>Geometry dash이란 무엇인가?</h2>
  <p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/322170/Geometry_Dash/"target = "_blank" title="이세계 최고의 망겜!!">Geometry Dash</a> is a 2D game that should be deleted. Please quit this game
  from now right away. The developer of this game, <strong><u>RobTop</u></strong>, is too lazy that he
  doesn't work for updates at all. How stupid.. Also the users of this game
  is just crazy. They don't care about newbies at all! If someone starts playing
  this game, I'm sure he will quit this game after at most 1 week. What the hell..</p>

  <p>For example, take note of 'pointercrate.com'. In this site, you can see top 150 hardest levels in Geometry Dash. But 99% of people can reach not even 10% of these levels.
    It's just crazy. Only a few top people can beat it, but Ironically, most people want to 'see(not play)' more hardest levels.. so creaters are just keeping making harder
    and harder levels.</p>
